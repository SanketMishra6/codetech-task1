## Overview of the Project

### Project:TEMPERATURE CONVERSION ON THREE DIFFERENT SCALES

## Objective
The provided code is a C++ program that performs temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It defines a function convertTemperature that takes an input temperature value, the scale of the input temperature (fromScale), and the desired output scale (toScale). The function uses a switch-case statement to handle the conversion logic based on the input and output temperature scales.In the main function, the program prompts the user to enter the temperature value, the scale of the input temperature, and the scale to convert to. It then calls the convertTemperature function with the provided inputs and stores the converted temperature value. If the conversion is successfull the program displays the converted temperature along with the output scale.The conversion logic within the convertTemperature function involves specific formulas for converting between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales based on the input and output scale combinations. If an invalid scale is entered by the user, an error message is displayed indicating that the input scale should be either Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.

Technologies Used : C++ programming language

### Technology used: C++ programming language

## Conclusion
Overall, the code facilitates user input for temperature conversion and utilizes a function to perform the necessary calculations based on the specified temperature scales, providing the converted temperature as output if the conversion is valid.
